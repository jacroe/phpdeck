Creating a slideshow is easy with PHPDeck
=========================================


1) Create a folder with a short title of the presentation. You'll use this in the URL. 
2) Create your presentation using Markdown and save it in a file named "slides". You can use the demo presenation and Daring Fireball's Syntax page <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax> to see what you can do. 
3) Use three asterisks (* * *) to start a new slide. 
4) Add metadata to the top of the file. Example:
  Title
  Author
  design template
  slide transition type
5) Navigate to the web directory where PHPdeck is installed and append "?d={FolderName}" to view your presentation.
