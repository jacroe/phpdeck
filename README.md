Creating a slideshow is easy with PHPDeck
=========================================


1.	Create a folder with a short title of the presentation. You'll use this in the URL. 
2.	Create your presentation using Markdown and save it in a file named "slides". You can use the demo presenation and Daring Fireball's Syntax page <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax> to see what you can do. 
3.	Use three asterisks (* * *) to start a new slide. 
4.	Add metadata to the top of the file. See the demo slides for example.
5.	Navigate to the web directory where PHPdeck is installed and append "?d={FolderName}" to view your presentation.
